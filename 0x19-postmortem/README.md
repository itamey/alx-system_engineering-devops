Issue Summary:
On May 7th, 2023, between 2:00 AM and 6:00 AM (UTC-4), users were unable to access our online store, resulting in a four-hour outage. The issue affected 100% of our users, who received error messages when trying to access the website.

Timeline:
- 2:00 AM: Our monitoring system alerted us of high CPU usage on one of our servers.
- 2:10 AM: An engineer was alerted and started investigating the issue.
- 2:30 AM: The engineer discovered that the server was experiencing a high amount of traffic, but couldn't identify the source of the traffic.
- 3:00 AM: The engineer decided to increase the server's capacity to handle the traffic.
- 3:30 AM: After increasing the server's capacity, the engineer noticed that the server was still experiencing a high amount of traffic.
- 4:00 AM: The engineer involved the networking team to investigate the traffic.
- 5:00 AM: The networking team discovered that the traffic was caused by a DDoS attack on our website.
- 5:30 AM: The incident was escalated to the security team to mitigate the DDoS attack.
- 6:00 AM: The security team successfully mitigated the DDoS attack, and our website was fully restored.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was a DDoS attack on our website, which resulted in a large amount of traffic overwhelming our server and causing it to crash. To mitigate the attack, the security team implemented a variety of measures, including blocking the malicious traffic and implementing rate limiting on incoming requests. Additionally, the team worked with our hosting provider to increase our capacity to handle large amounts of traffic.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, we will be implementing the following measures:
- Implementing more advanced DDoS protection software to detect and block malicious traffic more quickly.
- Conducting regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities in our system.
- Improving our monitoring system to detect unusual spikes in traffic more quickly.
- Increasing our server capacity to handle larger amounts of traffic.
- Creating a detailed incident response plan to ensure a swift response to any future incidents.

Tasks to address the issue include:
- Research and implement advanced DDoS protection software.
- Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities in our system.
- Improve our monitoring system to detect unusual spikes in traffic more quickly.
- Increase server capacity to handle larger amounts of traffic.
- Create and test a detailed incident response plan.

Lessons Learned:

During this incident, we learned several valuable lessons that will help us better prepare for and respond to similar incidents in the future.

Firstly, it's important to have a robust incident response plan in place that clearly outlines roles and responsibilities and provides detailed procedures for detecting, investigating, and mitigating incidents. This plan should be regularly reviewed and tested to ensure its effectiveness.

Secondly, monitoring systems should be configured to detect not only technical issues but also potential security threats such as DDoS attacks. In this incident, our monitoring system detected the high CPU usage on the server, but it was not initially configured to alert us to potential security threats.

Finally, it's important to work closely with our hosting provider and other third-party vendors to ensure that we have the necessary resources and expertise to handle large-scale incidents. During this incident, our hosting provider was able to quickly increase our server capacity, which was crucial in mitigating the DDoS attack.

Moving forward, we will be implementing these lessons learned to improve our incident response capabilities and better protect our systems and customers.

Conclusion:

In summary, the four-hour outage on May 7th, 2023, was caused by a DDoS attack on our website, which resulted in a large amount of traffic overwhelming our server and causing it to crash. To mitigate the attack, our security team implemented a variety of measures, including blocking the malicious traffic and increasing our capacity to handle large amounts of traffic. Moving forward, we will be implementing additional measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, including implementing more advanced DDoS protection software, conducting regular security audits, and creating a detailed incident response plan.
